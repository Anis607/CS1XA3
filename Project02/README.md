CV Webpage:

I found my Template for this from https://www.wix.com/website/templates/html/portfolio-cv
Essentially I used to the template to basically create the layout/base of the webpage. I reasearched for hours and hourse on how to customize the webpage as I learned a lot on the way (How to add your own buttons, how to add images, How to create links to my projects etc.).


Tic Tac Toe App:

After looking a lot into HTML/CSS and JavaScripting, I then wrote down on pen and paper on how exactly I could make a tic tac toe game.
First, I looked at what Tic Tac Toe was and how to win it. Then, I constructed a bot that would basically check where the user would put an input and then it would counter with an approriate move.
I constructed the grid using CSS and my X's and O's were just enlarged letters.
I then thought of all winning combinations as I created a bot where the user would only lose or tie.
I did leave the option of winning if the user manages to win somehow but I believe I covered all winning combinations.
Once figuring out what the game is, I started programming the grid, the X's and O's, the computer's moves and the user's moves, as I discuessed the winning combinations.
I imported the CSS and Javascript files into my HTML file and now my game works.
